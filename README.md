# Hi there, I'm Eya Jlassi 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Data Science MSc student at École Polytechnique and an engineering student at ENSTA Paris. With a strong academic background in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Applied Mathematics, I enjoy tackling real-world challenges through innovative data-driven solutions.

Throughout my journey, I have applied my skills across diverse fields, embedding and augmenting heterogeneous graphs to predict insurance premium amounts. This has allowed me to leverage complex relationships in data for impactful predictions and solutions.

I thrive on collaboration, adapting quickly to new environments, and bringing creative ideas to life. I’m always eager to explore cutting-edge technologies and contribute to impactful projects that make a difference.

Currently, I am seeking a 6-month final-year internship starting in April 2025 to apply my expertise in Data Science to innovative projects. Additionally, I am an active Kaggle competitor, working hard to become an expert by tackling challenging data science problems and contributing to the community, being ranked among the top 2% in consecutive challenges.
